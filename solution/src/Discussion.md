This C++ program efficiently extracts logs for a specific date from a large log file using binary search.

It first finds the starting position of the target date using find_start_position().

Then, it extracts matching log entries using extract_logs().

The extracted logs are saved in an output file within the output/ directory.

The approach ensures fast retrieval even for large files.

Future improvements could include handling different date formats and optimizing file I/O operations.
